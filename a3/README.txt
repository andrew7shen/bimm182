BIMM 182 Assignment #3
4/27/23 - 5/17/23

List of all files in code submission
1) main.py: primary Python script with functions and code that performs calculations and formatting for Problems 2 and 4 in the homework
2) queries.txt: input list of query strings, dictionary #1
3) queries.txt: input list of query strings, dictionary #2
4) DNA.txt: input DNA string, represents genome
5) README.txt: README document that includes details on relevant code/text files and how to run code

How to run the code:
For Problem 1:
- no code written

For Problem 2:
- Reference main method to see the calculations for the speed-up and sensitivity values
- No external functions written for calculations

For Problem 3:
- no code written

For Problem 4:
- Reference main method to see processing of input files, e-value calculations for each dictionary, and calling of helper functions
- Use "aho_corasick_construction(patterns)" function to create Aho-Corasick trie, output in adjacency list format
- Use "aho_corasick_search(text, patterns, trie)" function AFTER constructing the trie to perform search of queries
